\section{Wavelet Transform}

\subsection{Overview}
Wavelet transforms have become increasingly important in digital signal processing and image processing since wavelets allow both time and frequency analysis simultaneously. The use of wavelets for these purposes is a recent development, although the theory is not new. The principles are similar to those of Fourier analysis, which was first developed in the early part of the 19th century.

In signal processing, wavelets make it possible to recover weak signals from noise . This has proven useful especially in the processing of X-ray and magnetic-resonance images in medical applications. Images processed in this way can be "cleaned up" without blurring or muddling the details.

\subsection{Definition}
A function $\psi \,\in\, L^2(\mathbb{R})$  is called an
orthonormal wavelet if it can be used to define a
, that is a
$L^2\left(\mathbb{R}\right)$ of
