In this project we have implemented \textbf{PET/CT Image Denoising and Segmentation based on a Multi Observation and a Multi Scale Markov Tree Model}. We have applied wavelet and contourlet transforms to denoise the image to utilize the advantage of both methods. For co segmentation of PET and CT images must be aligned first. Thus, we applied image registration . Finally, Segmentation was performed on PET and CT images using HMT. Our implementation gave us an excellent result of detecting tumors on both PET and CT images.

For the future, we would like to apply our algorithm on PET-MRI and MRI images, and work on enhancing the segmentation algorithm by integrating HMT  with evidence theory and neural network.
