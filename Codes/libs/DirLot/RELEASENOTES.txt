- DirLOT20130201

-- Major revision

-- Minor revision
--- Added sample codes for APSIPA2012

- DirLOT20121101

-- Major revision
--- Newly introduced some classes defined as System objects, 
    which are available for code generation and embedded implementation 
    on BeagleBoard-xM and PandaBoard-ES. See folder 'embedded.'

- DirLOT20120501

--- Added sample codes for ICASSP2012 
--- Added sample codes for PCS2012
--- Renamed mytest2008a.m to mytest.m

- DirLOT20111201

-- Major revision
--- Separable GenLOT classes were newly introduced. See folder 'genlot.'
--- Class AmplitudeErrorEnergy was introduced.
--- Class SubbandSpecification was modified to provide a new method 
    AmplitudeSpecification().
--- Testing frame work mlunit_2008a was experimentaly introduced.
-- Minor revision
--- quickstart.m was revised to evaluate PSNRs.
--- Some codes in samples were revised.
--- Dependencies on the deprecated class LpPuFb2d were reduced. 
--- Files mexcodes/supportExtensionHorizontal.m and 
    mexcodes/supportExtensionVertical.m were renamed to correct the spel. 

- DirLOT20111101

-- Minor revision: a bug in mexcodes/supportExtentionVertical.m was fixed.

- DirLot20110818

-- ForwardDirLot.m and InverseDirLot.m were modified for acceleration.
-- The subband assignment in SubbandSpecification.m was revised.
-- Many sample scripts were appended.

- DirLot20110112

-- Bugs in PSNR calcuation were fixed. 
   The following codes contained the bugs:

 samples/icip2009/main_icip2009dct.m
 samples/icip2009/main_icip2009dirlot.m
 samples/icip2009/main_icip2009dwt97.m
 dirlot/DirectionalDwtQuantizer.m
 dirlot/DirectionalDwtQuantizerTest.m
 dirlot/UniformSubbandQuanizer.m
 dirlot/UniformSubbandQuantizerTest.m
 appendix/Dwt97Quantizer.m
 appendix/Dwt97QuantizerTest.m

The calcuation should have been written as 

 sI=im2uint8(I);
 sX=im2uint8(X);
 psnr = 10*log10( (255^2)*numel(sI)/sum((int16(sI(:))-int16(sX(:))).^2));

although it was wrongly implemented as  

 sI=im2uint8(I);
 sX=im2uint8(X);
 psnr = 10*log10( (255^2)*numel(sI)/sum((sI(:)-sX(:)).^2));

- DirLot20101201

-- Design with trend vanishing moments (TVMs) was supported.
-- Implementation of class LpPuFb2d was divided into four
   classes LpPuFb2dVm0, LpPuFb2dVm1, LpPuFb2dVm2 and LpPuFb2dTvm in
   terms of the vanishing moment condition. Class LpPuFb2d was
   modified as a bridge to these new classes for maintaining the
   compatibity with the previous releases.
-- Many sample scripts were appended.

- DirLot20100313 

-- A synchronization problem in parallel computing of 'ga' and
   'fmincon' was fixed.

- DirLot20100107 

-- Class LpPuFb2d was modified so that a cell format of parameter
   matrix set can be accepted.

- DirLot20091221 

-- Working with Genetic Algorithm and Parallel Computing Toolbox
   became available for the design process.

- DirLot20091210 

-- Dependency of class LpPuFb2d on class PolyPhaseMatrix2d was reduced
   for acceleration of the design process.

- DirLot20091130 

-- Functions im2col and col2im were used instead of function colfilt.
-- Revised for supporting MATLAB releases from R2008a to R2009a again.

- DirLot20091129 

-- ForwardDirLot.m and InverseDirLot.m were modified for acceleration
   by removing the dependency on BlockWiseAnalyzer.m and
   BlockWiseSynthesizer.m.
