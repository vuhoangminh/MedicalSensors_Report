% SINERAMP  - Generates sine on a ramp colourmap test image
%
% The test image consists of a sine wave superimposed on a ramp function The
% amplitude of the sine wave is modulated from its full value at the top of the
% image to 0 at the bottom. 
%
% The image is useful for evaluating the effectiveness of different colourmaps.
% Ideally the sine wave pattern should be equally discernible over the full
% range of the colourmap.  In practice many colourmaps have uneven perceptual
% contrast over their range and often include 'flat spots' of no perceptual
% contrast that can hide significant features.
%
% Usage: im = sineramp(sze, amp, wavelen, p)
%        im = sineramp;
%
% Arguments:     sze - [rows cols] specifying size of test image.  If a
%                      single value is supplied the image is square. 
%                      Defaults to [256 512];
%                amp - Amplitude of sine wave. Defaults to 10.
%            wavelen - Wavelength of sine wave in pixels. Defaults to 10.
%                  p - Power to which the linear attenuation of amplitude, 
%                      from top to bottom, is raised.  For no attenuation use
%                      p = 0. For contrast sensitivity experiments use larger
%                      values of p.  The default value is 2.
% 
% The ramp function that the sine wave is superimposed on is sized so that the
% overall greyscale range of the test image is 0-255 (nominally).  Thus using a
% large sine wave amplitude will result in a reduced ramp function being used.
%
% To start with try
%  >> im = sineramp;  
%
% This is equivalent to the call 
%  >> im = sineramp([256 512], 10, 10, 2);
%
% View it under 'gray' then try the 'jet', 'hsv', 'hot' etc colourmaps.  The
% results may cause you some concern!
